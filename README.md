# Automation_Project
Hi, 
This is first project called Automation project. This project has 3 different tasks:- 
Task1 : To create IAM role, Security Group , EC2 instance and S3 bucket. EC2 bucket is the WebServer with Apache2 installed. S3 bucket is used for storing the WebServer logs.
Task2: We need to write the bash script to automate maintainence tasks. Write scripts to update packages, update the S3 bucket setup in EC2 instance. Run the apache2 server if not installed. create a tar file and finally tag them in github
Task3: Upgrade the existing automation.sh script to create record when the tar file is copied to EC2 to S3. Running cron job and script it to update at regular interval of time.
